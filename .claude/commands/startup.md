You are initiating the "Project Startup Protocol." Please execute the following steps sequentially:

1.  **Git Synchronization**
    - Run `git status` to ensure the directory is clean.
    - If clean, run `git pull` to ensure we have the latest remote changes.

2.  **Context Retrieval**
    - Check for a file named `AI_HANDOFF.md` in the root directory.
    - **If found:** Read it to understand the current project state and the "Next Steps" defined in the previous session.
    - **If NOT found:** Scan the `README.md` and the last 3 git commit messages to orient yourself, then create a new `AI_HANDOFF.md` file using the current context.

3.  **Plan Formulation**
    - Based specifically on the "Next Steps" from the handoff file, outline the plan for this session.
    - Do not write code yet. Present the plan and wait for my approval.
