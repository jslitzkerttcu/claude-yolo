You are initiating the "Project Shutdown Protocol." Please execute the following steps sequentially:

1.  **Update Handoff Documentation**
    - Open (or create) `AI_HANDOFF.md`.
    - Update the "Current State" section to reflect what we accomplished today.
    - **CRITICAL:** Clear the old "Next Steps" and write a new, granular list of instructions for the *next* session. Include any known bugs or unfinished logic.

2.  **Code Quality Check**
    - Briefly review the files we modified today. Ensure there are no leftover debug print statements or commented-out blocks that shouldn't be there.

3.  **Git Operations**
    - Run `git add .`
    - Generate a concise but descriptive commit message based on the work done.
    - Run `git commit -m "your_message"`
    - Run `git push`

4.  **Final Status**
    - Confirm when the push is successful and the handoff file is saved.
